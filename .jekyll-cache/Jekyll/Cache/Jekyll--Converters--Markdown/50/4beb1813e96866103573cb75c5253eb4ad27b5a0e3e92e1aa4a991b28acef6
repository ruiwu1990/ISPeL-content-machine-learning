I"¨<p>There are many sentence patterns defined within a language.  Some familiar types of sentence patterns are</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>question</strong> â€œWhat is the date of today?â€</li>
  <li><strong>command</strong> â€œComplete this assignment by Monday.â€</li>
  <li><strong>exclamation</strong> â€œIt is Friday!â€</li>
  <li><strong>subjective sentences</strong> â€œTennis is the best sport.â€</li>
  <li><strong>objective sentences, statements</strong> â€œThe first President of the United States was George Washington.â€</li>
</ol>

<p>Objective statements have either True or False. The truth of the statement can either be validated by referencing a defintion that
is universally accepted or from the direct implication of an axiom (a statement of true conditions) or another statement that has been shown to be true.</p>

<p>In this module, we focus on objective statements.</p>
