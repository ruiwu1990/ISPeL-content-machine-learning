  <li>Correlation can be used to represent relationships between variables.</li>
  <li>Positive Correlation: both variables change in the same direction.</li>
  <li>Neutral Correlation: No relationship in the change of the variables.
â€“ Negative Correlation: variables change in opposite directions.</li>
  <li>Pearsonâ€™s Correlation vs Spearmanâ€™s Correlation
â€“ The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.
â€“ Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient (named for Charles Spearman) can be used to summarize the strength between the two data samples, if two variables may be related by a nonlinear relationship or two variables being considered may have a non-Gaussian distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="covariance-vs-correlation">Covariance vs Correlation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Covariance is nothing but a measure of correlation. On the contrary, correlation refers to the scaled form of covariance.</li>
  <li>The value of correlation takes place between -1 and +1. Conversely, the value of covariance lies between -âˆ and +âˆ.</li>
  <li>Covariance is affected by the change in scale, i.e. if all the value of one variable is multiplied by a constant and all the value of another variable are multiplied, by a similar or different constant, then the covariance is changed. As against this, correlation is not influenced by the change in scale.</li>
  <li>Correlation is dimensionless, i.e. it is a unit-free measure of the relationship between variables. Unlike covariance, where the value is obtained by the product of the units of the two variables.</li>
