  <li>Correlation can be used to represent relationships between variables.
    <ul>
      <li>Positive Correlation: both variables change in the same direction.</li>
      <li>Neutral Correlation: No relationship in the change of the variables.</li>
      <li>Negative Correlation: variables change in opposite directions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pearson‚Äôs Correlation vs Spearman‚Äôs Correlation
    <ul>
      <li>The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.</li>
      <li>Spearman‚Äôs correlation coefficient (named for Charles Spearman) can be used to summarize the strength between the two data samples, if two variables may be related by a nonlinear relationship or two variables being considered may have a non-Gaussian distribution.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="covariance-vs-correlation">Covariance vs Correlation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Covariance is nothing but a measure of correlation. On the contrary, correlation refers to the scaled form of covariance.</li>
  <li>The value of correlation takes place between -1 and +1. Conversely, the value of covariance lies between -‚àû and +‚àû.</li>
  <li>Covariance is affected by the change in scale, i.e. if all the value of one variable is multiplied by a constant and all the value of another variable are multiplied, by a similar or different constant, then the covariance is changed. As against this, correlation is not influenced by the change in scale.</li>
  <li>Correlation is dimensionless, i.e. it is a unit-free measure of the relationship between variables. Unlike covariance, where the value is obtained by the product of the units of the two variables.</li>
</ul>

\[cov_{xy} =  \sigma _{xy} = E[X- \mu _Y)]\]

\[corr_{xy} =   \rho  _{xy} = E[X- \mu _Y)]/( \sigma _X \sigma _Y)\]
