## Traveling Salesperson Problem
* Deliver ECU T-shirts to 7 stores in Greenville.
* Brute force time complexity: N!, N is the number of vertices.
* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* GA: Inspired by genetic evolution process:
  * Chromosome (population)
  * Crossover
  * Mutation
  * Survival of fittest
* Advantage: no need to know the best way to solve the problem, try different possible solutions until results converge
* Key <font color=red>evaluate solutions</font> and <font color=red>generate different solutions</font>

## High Level GA

* Natural Selection
* Chromosome includes information and rules can filter unfitted chromosomes.

## Traveling Salesperson Problem
* Letâ€™s come back to the TSP problem.
* If we can encode a TSP solution (maybe not a good one) into a chromosome and define rules to filter unfitted chromosomes, we may generate better results.

## GA Workflow

* Steps:

## Traveling Salesperson Problem

{% include marginfigure.html id="PCA" url="machine-learning/GA/ga7.png" description="<a name='figure5'>Figure 5</a> Traveling Salesperson Problem" %}

* How to define a path using Chromosome idea?
* Similarly, each TSP solution should contain all the vertices exact once (path not a circuit). [Figure](#figure5)

## Crossover: Method 1

{% include marginfigure.html id="PCA" url="machine-learning/GA/ga8.png" description="<a name='figure6'>Figure 6</a> Crossover: Method 1" %}

* How to generate new chromosomes: Crossover and Mutation.
* Crossover 1: Select last N numbers from P2, and take them out from P1
* Each solution needs to include all the vertices based on TSP. [Figure](#figure6)

## Crossover: Method 2

{% include marginfigure.html id="PCA" url="machine-learning/GA/ga12.png" description="<a name='figure7'>Figure 7</a> Crossover: Method 2" %}

* Crossover 2: Select last N numbers from P1, and take them out from P2 [Figure](#figure7)

## Mutation: Method 1

{% include marginfigure.html id="PCA" url="machine-learning/GA/ga9.png" description="<a name='figure8'>Figure 8</a> Mutation: Method 1" %}

* Mutation 1: change order [Figure](#figure8)

## Mutation: Method 2

{% include marginfigure.html id="PCA" url="machine-learning/GA/ga10.png" description="<a name='figure9'>Figure 9</a> Mutation: Method 2" %}

* Mutation 2: change position [Figure](#figure9)

## When to stop?
* When your results converge.

## GA limitations
* It is hard to implement a real time GA application.
  * How to solve this issue?
* GA may not find out the global optimal solution.
